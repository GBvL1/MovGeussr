This project is a game where you guess what movie is being hinted towards with hints like actors, director, movie description, genre and other characteristics. 


We have used a MVP structure where the model handles the data given from the api and the user to make it usable for the presenter to interpret it for the view which visualizes the program.

Hi, 

Welcome to our MovGuessr game! Here are some pointers on how to create an account an play the game!

1\. At the top right of your screen you will see three buttons. One for the leader board, one for settings and one for your account. To create an account you press the top right button where you can either log in to an existing account or create a new one. 

2\. In settings you can adjust volume for music and effects

3\. The leader board shows the accounts with the highest amount of points.

##### **Instructions** 

There are some basic and easy rules that you should follow to play and enjoy our little game! After creating your account you can select a difficulty, either hard or easy mode.

After selecting a difficulty you will be given three hints. 

**EASY MODE:** If you have selected easy mode you will get the main role, movie poster and director as your hints, as well as three lives.   

**HARD MODE:** If you have selected hard mode you will get the same amount of hints, but only have one life. 

Each game consists of 20 rounds, where you get 1 point for each correct answer per round. After the 20th round the game will be over, but don't worry! You can just play another round until you have proven yourself to be the biggest movie nerd in the room! 

Your highscore will be displayed on your profile as well as the leaderboard. It will only update if you manage to beat it. 

ENJOY!
